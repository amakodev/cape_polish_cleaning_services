I want to build a website called CapePolish for Cleaning Services for a cape town client with the goal of lead generation and order processing. 

This is the service that was provided: 
- cleaning 
- Private cleaning
- Commercial buildings
- Car cleaning
- Carpet cleaning
- Gardening 
- Waste removal

I need help with building from scratch, starting from branding to deployment to start accepting customers.

We want a full, responsive, and professional single-page landing page with pages for more information about services. We want it to be user-friendly with AI assistance across the website.

Be creative and construct a high-converting design and content writing. Impress me with stunning modern and clean design and high performing animations and interactive components

As an extra I want to add a lead generator and order form, as well as a faq assistant with cheap ai model (gpt 3.5) and admin panel accessible via a password. Clients who provide their email can use it to see communications and order tracking, therefore we also need a client panel.

This is quite a project, let's keep things as minimalistic and clean as possible, let's get started on amazing work
