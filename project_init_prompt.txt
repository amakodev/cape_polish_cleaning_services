I want to build a website called CapePolish for Cleaning Services for a cape town client with the goal of lead generation and order processing. 

This is the service that was provided: 
- cleaning 
- Private cleaning
- Commercial buildings
- Car cleaning
- Carpet cleaning
- Gardening 
- Waste removal

I need help with building from scratch, starting from branding to deployment to start accepting customers.

We want a full, responsive, and professional single-page landing page with pages for more information about services. We want it to be user-friendly with AI assistance across the website.

Be creative and construct a high-converting design and content writing. Impress me with stunning modern and clean design and high performing animations and interactive components

As an extra I want to add a lead generator and order form, as well as a faq assistant with cheap ai model (gpt 3.5) and admin panel accessible via a password. Clients who provide their email can use it to see communications and order tracking, therefore we also need a client panel.

This is quite a project, let's keep things as minimalistic and clean as possible, let's get started on amazing work 

Our tech stack should include:
tailwind css 4.1 
firebase for database
...and any relevant latest packages for high quality implementations with a simple codebase

Here are the docs for installing tailwind css with vite:
[Installing Tailwind CSS as a Vite plugin is the most seamless way to integrate it with frameworks like Laravel, SvelteKit, React Router, Nuxt, and SolidJS.

01
Install Tailwind CSS
Install tailwindcss and @tailwindcss/vite via npm.

Terminal
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
02
Configure the Vite plugin
Add the @tailwindcss/vite plugin to your Vite configuration.

vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tailwindcss(),
  ],
})
03
Import Tailwind CSS
Add an @import to your CSS file that imports Tailwind CSS.

CSS
@import "tailwindcss";
04
Start your build process
Run your build process with npm run dev or whatever command is configured in your package.json file.


05
Start using Tailwind in your HTML
Make sure your compiled CSS is included in the <head> (your framework might handle this for you), then start using Tailwindâ€™s utility classes to style your content.
